5.4 - Summary Levels

The ACS Summary Files cover geographic areas based on “summary levels.” 
A summary level specifies the content and the hierarchical relationships of the geographic elements 
that are required to tabulate and summarize data. For example, summary level code “40” represents 
the U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico; while summary level code “50” represents counties 
and county equivalents within states.

Summary levels currently contained in the ACS Summary Files stored on data.world:

SummaryLevel Description
10           Country (USA)
20           Region
30           Division
40           U.S. states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico
50           Counties and county equivalents
160          Place/City
320          Metropolitan and Micropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)
500          Congressional District
860          ZCTA (ZIP Census Tabulation Area - akin to ZIP Code)

With the exception of the USA_All_States files, the United States level does not contain tables for geographies 
that are always entirely within a state, such as counties and places; for those tables, go to the file for that state. 
ZIP Census Tabulation Areas are in the United States level, because some ZIP codes span more than one state.
